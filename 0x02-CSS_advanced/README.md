# Advanced CSS Learning & Website Styling Project

### This project serves two purposes:

1. **Advanced CSS Exploration:** I'm actively learning advanced CSS techniques to elevate my styling skills. Here, I'll document the specific topics I'm focusing on and relevant resources for reference.
2. **Website Styling Practice:** To put my newfound knowledge into action, I'll be styling a website using the advanced CSS concepts I learn. The website itself (name and purpose) will be defined further down the line.

### Learning Resources:

This section will be populated with links and references to tutorials, documentation, or courses I'm using to learn advanced CSS. Some potential areas of focus could be:
- [CSS Reference - A free visual guide to CSS](https://cssreference.io/)
- [Can I use,,, Support tables for HTML5, CSS3, etc](https://caniuse.com/)
- [CSS Properties | HTML Dog](https://htmldog.com/references/css/properties/)
- [Box Sizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing)
- [CSS specificity calculator](https://specificity.keegan.st/)
- [Play with CSS selector](https://flukeout.github.io/)


Feel free to explore and learn!
